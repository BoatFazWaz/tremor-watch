# Test File Location Rules

## File Location
- Test files should be located in the same directory as the source file they are testing
- Test files should use the `.test` suffix before the file extension
- Test file name should match the source file name

## Naming Convention
- For a source file: `Component.tsx`
- The test file should be: `Component.test.tsx`
